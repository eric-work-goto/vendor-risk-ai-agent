# Compliance System Changes - Dynamic AI-Powered Discovery Only

## Summary
Successfully removed ALL hardcoded compliance URLs and implemented pure OpenAI API-powered dynamic discovery as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. UI Labels Verification
- ✅ Confirmed UI labels are already correct:
  - "Data Flow Documentation Discovery" (NO "AI" prefix)
  - "Compliance Documentation Discovery" (NO "AI" prefix)

### 2. Removed Hardcoded Compliance URLs

#### Functions Modified in `src/api/web_app.py`:

1. **`fetch_public_documents()`**
   - ❌ Removed: 60+ hardcoded URLs for major vendors (Slack, Salesforce, Google, AWS, Microsoft, GitHub, Zoom)
   - ✅ Replaced: Now uses only `enhance_compliance_discovery_with_ai()` for dynamic discovery

2. **`get_known_compliance_urls()`**
   - ❌ Removed: Entire function with hardcoded URL mappings
   - ✅ Replaced: With comment directing to use dynamic discovery

3. **`download_trust_center_document()`**
   - ❌ Removed: Hardcoded URL conditional logic
   - ✅ Replaced: With dynamic discovery using `DynamicComplianceDiscovery`

4. **`download_compliance_document()`**
   - ❌ Removed: References to hardcoded `known_document_urls`
   - ✅ Replaced: With dynamic discovery flow

5. **`discover_public_compliance_pages()`**
   - ❌ Removed: 100+ hardcoded URL patterns for GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, PCI-DSS
   - ✅ Replaced: With pure OpenAI API discovery using `enhance_compliance_discovery_with_ai()`

6. **`_standard_compliance_discovery()`**
   - ❌ Removed: 80+ hardcoded URL patterns for all compliance frameworks
   - ✅ Replaced: With OpenAI API discovery only

## Current System Behavior

### OpenAI API Integration
- ✅ All compliance document discovery now uses `enhance_compliance_discovery_with_ai()`
- ✅ Dynamic discovery powered by GPT-3.5-turbo
- ✅ No fallback to hardcoded URLs
- ✅ Intelligent URL generation based on vendor domain analysis

### Compliance Frameworks Supported
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) 
- HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
- SOC2 (Service Organization Control 2)
- ISO27001 (Information Security Management)

### Discovery Process
1. User requests compliance documents for a vendor
2. System calls `enhance_compliance_discovery_with_ai()` with vendor domain
3. OpenAI API analyzes vendor and generates likely compliance document URLs
4. System validates and returns discovered documents
5. "View" button functionality uses only AI-discovered links

## Verification
- ✅ UI labels confirmed correct (no "AI" prefixes)
- ✅ All hardcoded URLs removed from main web_app.py
- ✅ Only backup files contain old hardcoded URLs
- ✅ Dynamic discovery system ready for testing

## Testing
Run `python test_compliance_system.py` to verify:
- UI labels are correct
- System uses only dynamic discovery
- No hardcoded URLs remain

## Impact
- **Flexibility**: System adapts to any vendor automatically
- **Intelligence**: OpenAI API provides smarter URL discovery
- **Maintenance**: No need to manually update hardcoded URLs
- **Scalability**: Works with any vendor domain without configuration
