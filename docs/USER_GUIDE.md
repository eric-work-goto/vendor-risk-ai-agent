## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### Data Sensitivity
- Tool performs external scans only - no internal system access
- Results based on publicly available information
- Supplement with vendor-provided documentation when needed

### Limitations
- Results are point-in-time assessments
- May not capture all vendor security controls
- Should be combined with vendor questionnaires and certifications

### Escalation Procedures
- **Critical Risk (Score < 30)**: Immediate security team review required
- **New Data Breaches Discovered**: Alert vendor management team
- **Compliance Gaps**: Engage legal and compliance teams

## üÜò Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Assessment Stuck/Not Progressing**
   - Refresh the page and restart assessment
   - Check if vendor domain is accessible publicly

2. **No AI Features Detected for Known AI Vendors**
   - Verify the domain is the primary company domain
   - Some vendors may have AI features under different domains

3. **Compliance Status Shows "Unknown"**
   - Vendor may not have public compliance documentation
   - Request compliance certificates directly from vendor
