## 4. Technical Implementation Details

### Security Intelligence System:
```javascript
// AI-powered security intelligence gathering
async function gather_security_intelligence(vendor_domain, vendor_name)
- Uses corporate OpenAI API (https://chat.expertcity.com/api/v1)
- Caches results for 6 hours per vendor
- Returns structured security event data
- Includes CVE IDs, severity levels, and recommended actions
```

### Enhanced Alert Processing:
```javascript
// Now includes security intelligence in alerts
async function generateAlertsFromAssessments(assessments)
- Processes each vendor assessment
- Calls security intelligence API
- Generates combined alerts (assessment + security events)
- Proper error handling for API failures
```

### Collapsible UI Components:
```javascript
function toggleAlerts() / toggleScoreChanges()
- Toggle visibility with smooth animations
- Update chevron icon rotation
- Maintain state across refreshes
```

## 5. Enhanced Features

### Alert Types Now Include:
1. **Risk-Based Alerts** (existing):
   - Critical Risk (<50 score)
   - High Risk (50-69 score)  
   - Medium Risk (70-79 score)

2. **Compliance Alerts** (existing):
   - GDPR Compliance issues
   - SOC Compliance issues

3. **NEW: Security Intelligence Alerts**:
   - Data Breach alerts with details
   - Vulnerability alerts with CVE IDs

   - Compliance violation reports

### Visual Improvements:
- **Color-Coded Badges**: Different colors for alert types and severity
- **Icon System**: Specific icons for each alert category
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Smooth Animations**: Collapsible sections with transition effects
- **Scroll Areas**: Prevents page overflow with large datasets

## 6. Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy:
- **Security Intelligence Cache**: 6-hour expiry per vendor
